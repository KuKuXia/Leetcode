# Testcase Example:  '["h","e","l","l","o"]'
#
# Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an
# array of characters char[].
#
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying
# the input arrayÂ in-place with O(1) extra memory.
#
# You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
#
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
# Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
# Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
