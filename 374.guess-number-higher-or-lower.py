# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
# 
# I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
# 
# Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or
# lower.
# 
# You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results
# (-1, 1, or 0):
# 
# 
# -1 : My number is lower
# ⁠1 : My number is higher
# ⁠0 : Congrats! You got it!
# 
# 
# Example :
# 
# 
# 
# Input: n = 10, pick = 6
# Output: 6
# 
# 
# 
#
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):
